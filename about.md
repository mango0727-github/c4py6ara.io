# About

Hi, my name is Joonyoung Jeong, but you can just call me Joon. I have been serving as a military officer since 2013. 

I am eager to study wireless security, especially cellular network security, because I believe wireless network security will be critical (it's already critical, it will become even more so in the future) as everything we carry is increasingly connected through wireless networks. With such growth in connectivity, there will inevitably be people trying to exploit vulnerabilities in wireless devices to infiltrate otherwise secure systems.

## Education

### Iowa State University (ISU)
M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aug 2021 - Jul 2023
### Korea Military Academy (KMA)
B.E. in Mechanical Engineering, Feb 2013 - Mar 2013

## Research Interest
My current research interest lies in wireless system security, especially:
- Cellular network security
- Reverse engineering (malware analysis)

During my M.S. program, my research focused on wireless communication (physical layer) security, leading to my thesis titled _"Covert Authentication for Securing MIMO Communications."_ Following graduation, I began my new career at a government agency that had fully sponsored my tuition fee and stipend. The security I dealt with was a little different from my research area in the M.S., and the work was both mentally and physically demanding. However, the security across different layers fascinated me so much that it motivated me to further delve into wireless security but at higher layers. 

## Publication
[Covert authentication for securing MIMO communications](https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/d0ca9bbb-4436-4681-97b7-c97fa3a4ec05/content) supervised by Sang Kim, ISU

## Teaching experience
I am currently working as a lecturer at the Korea Military Academy, teaching _Introduction to Statistics_ and _Introduction to Data Mining_. 

During my M.S., I worked as a teaching assistant for two semesters, where I ran _Communication Systems Lab I_ and _Communication Systems Lab II_. 


## My hobbies

I am passionate about tennis and horse riding. Especially, I feel privileged to have the opportunity to ride at the KMA as it has its own stable.

Hi, my name is Joonyoung Jeong. Here is my brief introduction:

**Hydejack** is a boutique [Jekyll] theme for hackers, nerds, and academics, with a focus on personal sites that are meant to impress. 

It includes a blog that is suitable for both prose and technical documentation, a portfolio to showcase your projects, and a resume template that looks amazing on the web and in print.

> Your complete presence on the web — A [blog], [portfolio], and [resume].
{:.lead}


## A Personal Site That Won't Disappear

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

Hydejack is all static sites. _HTML_. All you need is a web server — any web server — to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.


## A Free Blogging Theme
**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.-->

<!--
## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.-->

<!--projects-->


<!--## A Printable Resume
Get a resume that's consistent across the board — whether it's on the web, mobile, print, or [PDF](/assets/Resume.pdf).

## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

![w3m Screenshot](/assets/img/blog/w3m.png){:.tail width="1920" height="1260" loading="lazy"}

The Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser `w3m`.
{:.figcaption}


## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```html
<!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` -->
<!--<script type="module">
  document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
    const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!
  });
</script>
```

Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.
{:.figcaption}


## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi(x,y) &= \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right) \\[2em]
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
               \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
                 \phi(e_1, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                 \vdots          & \ddots & \vdots         \\
                 \phi(e_n, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
               \end{array}\right)
               \left(\begin{array}{c}
                 y_1    \\
                 \vdots \\
                 y_n
               \end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.
