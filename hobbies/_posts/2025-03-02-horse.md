Now, we've stopped for a moment until our little one comes to the world!

We rode at a new stable because our team leader made a contract with the new stable. My horse kept biting my wife's horse's butt, which was so funny. 
Also, we met a beautiful white horse and a friendly dog at the barn in the picture. 

## December 2024 Ride

Again, new stable. The stable we went that day was so decent, clean, and luxurious. I thought we should be going this stable forever. But, one problem, it was a bit more expensive than other stables near our house. 

## November 2024 Ride

We came to this new stable because the stable we were going to was severely demaged because of heavy snow last week. Our leader said the roof of the stable completely came down to the ground as it could not stand the weight of snow. Poor.. Anyways, it would take quite amount of time for them to recover their stable. Thankfully, no one and no horse got hurt from it.
