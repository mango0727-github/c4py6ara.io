## Nature of horses

Horses are very sensitive to their surroundings and are easy to be startled. 

### What I have learned about them
* They move their ears toward the direction they're paying attention to.

### Keep in mind when riding them

* Always keep the reins taut so that the horse feels under control.
* When trotting, straighten your arms and put your fists just above the pommel (saddle head). If your fists move around while riding, the horse may take that as a signal and become confused.
* When stepping onto the stirrups, always use the balls of your feet, not the middle, and keep your heels down, below your toes.
* If they get startled, give them some rein. If you pull hard on the reins, they may rear, which can be very dangerous.
