## IP Multimedia Subsystem

For voice service, 5G provides IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) to specifically deliver speech packets. Before UEs communicate their speech packets, they should register first and a server-CSCF has to be allocated to the UEs by UDM or Interrogate-CSCF. The following figure illustrates the architecture of the IMS when a UE first attempts SIP signalling.

> SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is somehow self-explanatory. It is used for signalling between UEs and the IMS when you firstly register UEs and invite your callee, in which QoS Flow within a PDU session is used for delivering the signalling messages from UEs to the UPF and N6 interface is used between the UPF and the IMS.
