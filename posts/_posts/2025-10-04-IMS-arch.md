## IP Multimedia Subsystem

For voice service, 5G provides IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) to specifically deliver speech packets. Before UEs communicate their speech packets, they should register first and a server-CSCF has to be allocated to the UEs by UDM or Interrogate-CSCF. The following figure illustrates the architecture of the IMS when a UE first attempts SIP signalling.
