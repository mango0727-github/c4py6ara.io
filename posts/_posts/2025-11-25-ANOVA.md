ANOVA is to compare means of two or more populations. The idea is simple.

$$F= frac{1}{1} $$

All in all, the estimation is done based on samples collected from populations, and we are trying to test whether all population means are equal or at least one of them is different. We assume that each population is normally distributed with a common variance. Under this model, the F statistic (the ratio of between-group to within-group mean squares) follows an F distribution under the null hypothesis.
We then use this distribution to perform a hypothesis test about the equality of the means..
