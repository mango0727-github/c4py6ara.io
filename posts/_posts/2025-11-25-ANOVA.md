ANOVA is to compare means of two or more populations. The idea is simple.

All in all, the estimation is done based on samples collected from populations, and we are trying to test whether all population means are equal or at least one of them is different. We assume that each population is normally distributed with a common variance. Under this model, the F-statistic is defined as:

$$ F = \frac{\text{mean of squared deviations between groups}}{\text{mean of squared deviations within groups}} = \frac{
  \dfrac{1}{k-1}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k n_i \left(\bar x_i - \bar x_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^2
}{
  \dfrac{1}{N-k}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \left(x_{ij} - \bar x_i\right)^2
} $$

where $k-1$ is the degree-of-freedom for between-group variance, and $N-k$ is the degree-of-freedom for within-group variance. $N$ is the number of samples, and $k$ is the number of groups. The F-statistic follows an F-distribution under the null hypothesis.
